# Searching-in-Linked-Lists-and-Arrays

Linked Lists vs. Arrays - Comparative Study

Overview:
This Python application aims to explore and compare the performance of two fundamental data structures, linked lists and arrays, in handling a specific problem. The project involves generating random integers within a given range, storing them in either a linked list or an array, and performing various operations on the data.

Objective:
The key objectives of this project are:
1. Create and manipulate linked lists and arrays.
2. Perform operations such as adding, deleting, searching, changing, and sorting data.
3. Develop high-performance solutions using both data structures.
4. Compare the theoretical (algorithmic) complexities with empirical (real-world) complexities.

Problem Specification:
The project consists of the following tasks:
1. Generate 'n' random integers in the range [1, m].
2. Store the generated numbers in a linked list (doubly-linked list).
3. Count how many numbers in the linked list are greater than 50.
4. Depending on the count, sort the list in non-decreasing or non-increasing order and delete the second element.
5. Insert the number 10 in its correct position without disrupting the order.
6. Output the data in the final linked list.
7. Repeat steps 2 to 5 using arrays instead of linked list
8. Theoretical complexity analysis using Big O notation.
9. Empirical measurement of time and space complexity.
10. Comparison of theoretical and empirical complexities.

Input:
The application takes input 'm' (the upper bound for random number generation) and 'r' (the number of repetitions for each value of 'n' to measure average time).

Values of 'n':
The project explores various values of 'n', including 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 50000, 100000, etc., to test the limits of the machine's processing capabilities.

Note:
For 'n' greater than 100, there's no need to output the final linked list or array.

This project serves as an excellent opportunity to gain insights into the practical differences between linked lists and arrays while applying theoretical and empirical complexity analysis techniques.
